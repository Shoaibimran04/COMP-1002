        </h2>

        <p>
            1. Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet
            2. Heat the skillet over medium heat
            3. Butter one side of each slice of bread
            4. Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet
            5. Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area
            6. Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
            7. Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)
            8. Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
            9. Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese

        <h3>Note:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</li>
